# Flashcard Generator
UofA Bootcamp Week 11 Homework: Cloze Constructors

### Overview

In this week's assignment, you will create the backend for a basic flashcard application.

The backend will essentially constitute an API that allows users to create two types of flashcards.

1. **Basic** flashcards, which have a front (_"Who was the first president of the United States?"_), and a back (_"George Washington"_).

2. **Cloze-Deleted** flashcards, which present _partial_ text (_"... was the first president of the United States."_), and the full text when the user requests it (_"George Washington was the first president of the United States."_)

#### Cloze Deletions

A **cloze deletion** is simply a sentence that has had some of its text removed. For example, given the sentence:

_"George Washington was the first president of the United States."_

...We can create a "cloze deletion" by removing the words _"George Washington"_:

_"... was the first president of the United States."_

This is useful for building flash card applications that forces users to remember the important part of a sentence, and is [a common device in educational applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test).

A flash card built this way has three parts:

1. The **full text**. This is the entire sentence users need to remember:  _"George Washington was the first president of the United States."_

2. The **cloze deletion**. This is the text we've chosen to remove: _"George Washington"_.

3. The **partial text**. This is what we get if we remove the **cloze deletion** from the **full text**: _"... was the first president of the United States._

See below for examples as to how your constructor should behave.

## Instructions

* Create a new GitHub repository, named `Flashcard-Generator` or something similar. Clone this to your local drive.

* Create a new file named `BasicCard.js`:

  * This file should define a Node module that exports a constructor for creating basic flashcards, e.g.:
    `module.exports = BasicCard;`

  * The constructor should accept two arguments: `front` and `back`.

  * The constructed object should have a `front` property that contains the text on the front of the card.

  * The constructed object should have a `back` property that contains the text on the back of the card.

* Create a new file named `ClozeCard.js`:

  * This file should define a Node module that exports a constructor for creating cloze-deletion flashcards, e.g.:
    `module.exports = ClozeCard;`

  * The constructor should accept two arguments: `text` and `cloze`.

  * The constructed object should have a `cloze` property that contains _only_ the cloze-deleted portion of the text.

  * The constructed object should have a `partial` property that contains _only_ the partial text.

  * The constructed object should have a `fullText` property that contains _only_ the full text.

  * The constructor should throw or log an error when the cloze deletion does _not_ appear in the input text.

  * Use prototypes to attach these methods, wherever possible.

The bulk of this assignment is implementing `ClozeCard`. If you build a robust `ClozeCard` implementation, feel free to try your hand at implementing a front-end, as well.

### Examples

Your constructors should work as follows.

```
var firstPresident = new BasicCard(
    "Who was the first president of the United States?", "George Washington");

// "Who was the first president of the United States?"
console.log(firstPresident.front);

// "George Washington"
console.log(firstPresident.back);

var firstPresidentCloze = new ClozeCard(
    "George Washington was the first president of the United States.", "George Washington");

// "George Washington"
console.log(firstPresidentCloze.cloze);

// " ... was the first president of the United States.
console.log(firstPresidentCloze.partial); "

// "George Washington was the first president of the United States.
console.log(firstPresidentCloze.fullText): "

// Should throw or log an error because "oops" doesn't appear in "This doesn't work"
var brokenCloze = new ClozeCard("This doesn't work", "oops");
```

### Bonuses

* Write your constructors such that users can call them with or without the `new` keyword.

  * Look up scope-safe constructors, and try to implement them. It takes only two additional lines of code.
